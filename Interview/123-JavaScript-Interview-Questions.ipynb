    "## Question 1. What's the difference between `undefined` and `not defined` in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript if you try to use a variable that doesn't exist and has not been declared, then JavaScript will throw an error `var name is not defined` and the script will stop executing thereafter. But If you use `typeof undeclared_variable` then it will return `undefined`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting further discussion let's understand the difference between declaration and definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "`var x` is a declaration because we are not defining what value it holds yet, but we are declaring its existence and the need for memory allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var x; // declaring x\n",
    "console.log(x); // output: undefined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`var x = 1` is both declaration and definition, here declaration and assignment of value happen inline for variable x—what we are doing is called \"initialisation\". In JavaScript both variable declarations and function declarations go to the top of the scope in which they are declared, then assignment happens—this series of events is called \"hoisting\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable can be declared but not defined. When we try to access it, It will result `undefined`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var x; // Declaration\n",
    "typeof x === 'undefined'; // Will return true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable can be neither declared nor defined. When we try to reference such variable then the result will be `not defined`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "console.log(y);  // Output: ReferenceError: y is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ref Link:\n",
    "[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20822022/javascript-variable-definition-declaration](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20822022/javascript-variable-definition-declaration)\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2. For which value of `x` the results of the following statements are not the same?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "if( x <= 100 ) {...}\n",
    "if( !(x > 100) ) {...}\n",
    "```\n",
    "<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "`NaN <= 100` is `false` and `NaN > 100` is also `false`, so if the\n",
    "value of `x` is `NaN`, the statements are not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same holds true for any value of x that being converted to type Number, returns `NaN`, e.g.: `undefined`, `[1,2,5]`, `{a:22}` , etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why you need to pay attention when you deal with numeric variables. `NaN` can’t be equal, less than or more than any other numeric value, so the only reliable way to check if the value is `NaN`, is to use the `isNaN()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3. What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the drawbacks of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects is that they are very memory inefficient.  When you do that, a new copy of the method is created for each instance of an object. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var Employee = function (name, company, salary) {\n",
    "  this.name = name || \"\";       \n",
    "  this.company = company || \"\";\n",
    "  this.salary = salary || 5000;\n",
    "\n",
    "  // We can create a method like this:\n",
    "  this.formatSalary = function () {\n",
    "      return \"$ \" + this.salary;\n",
    "  };\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "// Alternatively we can add the method to Employee's prototype:\n",
    "Employee.prototype.formatSalary2 = function() {\n",
    "    return \"$ \" + this.salary;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "//creating objects\n",
    "var emp1 = new Employee('Yuri Garagin', 'Company 1', 1000000);\n",
    "var emp2 = new Employee('Dinesh Gupta', 'Company 2', 1039999);\n",
    "var emp3 = new Employee('Erich Fromm', 'Company 3', 1299483);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case each instance variable `emp1`, `emp2`, `emp3` has its own copy of the`formatSalary` method. However the `formatSalary2` will only be added once to `Employee.prototype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4. What is “closure” in javascript? Can you provide an example?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "A closure is a function defined inside another function (called parent function) and as such it has access to the variables declared and defined within its parent function's scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "The closure has access to the variables in three scopes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable declared in his own scope\n",
    "- Variable declared in its parent function's scope\n",
    "- Variable declared in the global namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var globalVar = \"abc\"; //Global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "// Parent self-invoking function\n",
    "(function outerFunction (outerArg) { // start of outerFunction's scope\n",
    "\n",
    "  var outerFuncVar = 'x'; // Variable declared in outerFunction's function scope   \n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Closure self-invoking function\n",
    "  (function innerFunction (innerArg) { // start of innerFunction's scope\n",
    "\n",
    "    var innerFuncVar = \"y\"; // variable declared in innerFunction's function scope\n",
    "    console.log(         \n",
    "      \"outerArg = \" + outerArg + \"\\n\" +\n",
    "      \"outerFuncVar = \" + outerFuncVar + \"\\n\" +\n",
    "      \"innerArg = \" + innerArg + \"\\n\" +\n",
    "      \"innerFuncVar = \" + innerFuncVar + \"\\n\" +\n",
    "      \"globalVar = \" + globalVar);\n",
    "  \t\n",
    "  // end of innerFunction's scope\n",
    "  \n",
    "  })(5); // Pass 5 as parameter to our Closure\n",
    "\n",
    "// end of outerFunction's scope\n",
    "\n",
    "})(7); // Pass 7 as parameter to the Parent function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`innerFunction` is a closure which is defined inside `outerFunction` and consequently has access to all the variables which have been declared and defined within `outerFunction`'s scope as well as any variables residing in the program's global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the code above would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "outerArg = 7\n",
    "outerFuncVar = x\n",
    "innerArg = 5\n",
    "innerFuncVar = y\n",
    "globalVar = abc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5. Write a mul function which will work properly when invoked with following syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "console.log(mul(2)(3)(4)); // output : 24\n",
    "console.log(mul(4)(3)(4)); // output : 48\n",
    "```\n",
    "<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function mul (x) {\n",
    "  return function (y) { // anonymous function\n",
    "    return function (z) { // anonymous function\n",
    "      return x * y * z;\n",
    "    };\n",
    "  };\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the `mul` function accepts the first argument and returns an anonymous function which then takes the second parameter and returns one last anonymous function which finally takes the third and final parameter; the last function then multiplies `x`, `y` and `z`, and returns the result of the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Javascript, a function defined inside another function has access to the outer function's scope and can consequently return, interact with or pass on to other functions, the variables belonging to the scopes that incapsulate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A function is an instance of the Object type\n",
    "- A function can have properties and has a link to its constructor method\n",
    "- A function can be stored as a variable\n",
    "- A function can be passed as a parameter to another function\n",
    "- A function can be returned by another function\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",

    "## Question 6. How to empty an array in JavaScript?\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var arrayList =  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we empty the array above?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of ways by which we can empty an array, So let's discuss all the possible way by which we can empty an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "arrayList = [];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code above will set the variable `arrayList` to a new empty array. This is recommended if you don't have **references to the original array** `arrayList` anywhere else because It will actually create a new empty array. You should be careful with this way of empty the array, because if you have referenced this array from another variable, then the original reference array will remain unchanged, Only use this way if you have only referenced the array by its original variable `arrayList`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var arrayList = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']; // Created array\n",
    "var anotherArrayList = arrayList;  // Referenced arrayList by another variable\n",
    "arrayList = []; // Empty the array\n",
    "console.log(anotherArrayList); // Output ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 2\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "arrayList.length = 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code above will clear the existing array by setting its length to 0. This way of emptying an array will also update all the reference variables that point to the original array. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var arrayList = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']; // Created array\n",
    "var anotherArrayList = arrayList;  // Referenced arrayList by another variable\n",
    "arrayList.length = 0; // Empty the array by setting length to 0\n",
    "console.log(anotherArrayList); // Output []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 3\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "arrayList.splice(0, arrayList.length);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above implementation will also work perfectly. This way of empty the array will also update all the references of the original array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var arrayList = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']; // Created array\n",
    "var anotherArrayList = arrayList;  // Referenced arrayList by another variable\n",
    "arrayList.splice(0, arrayList.length); // Empty the array by setting length to 0\n",
    "console.log(anotherArrayList); // Output []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 4\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "while(arrayList.length) {\n",
    "  arrayList.pop();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above implementation can also empty the array. But not recommended to use often.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 7. How to check if an object is an array or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to find whether an object is instance of a particular class or not using `toString` method from `Object.prototype`\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var arrayList = [1 , 2, 3];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best use cases of type checking of an object is when we do method overloading in JavaScript. To understand this, let's say we have a method called `greet` which can take a single string and also a list of strings. To make our `greet` method workable in both situation we need to know what kind of parameter is being passed: is it single value or list of values?\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function greet(param) {\n",
    "  if() {\n",
    "    // here have to check whether param is array or not\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  else {\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the above implementation it might not necessary to check the type of the array, we can check for single value string and put array logic code in else block, let see below code for the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    " function greet(param) {\n",
    "   if(typeof param === 'string') {\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   else {\n",
    "     // If param is of type array then this block of code would execute\n",
    "   }\n",
    " }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's fine we can go with the previous two implementations, but when we have a situation like a parameter can be `single value`, `array`, and `object` type then we will be in trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back to checking the type of an object, As we mentioned that we can use `Object.prototype.toString`\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "if(Object.prototype.toString.call(arrayList) === '[object Array]') {\n",
    "  console.log('Array!');\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using `jQuery` then you can also used jQuery `isArray` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "if($.isArray(arrayList)) {\n",
    "  console.log('Array');\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "  console.log('Not an array');\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "FYI jQuery uses `Object.prototype.toString.call` internally to check whether an object is an array or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern browser, you can also use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "Array.isArray(arrayList);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`Array.isArray` is supported by Chrome 5, Firefox 4.0, IE 9, Opera 10.5 and Safari 5\n",

    "```javascript\n",
    "var trees = [\"redwood\", \"bay\", \"cedar\", \"oak\", \"maple\"];\n",
    "delete trees[3];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n",
    " - When you run the code above and do `console.log(trees);` in chrome developer console then you will get `[\"redwood\", \"bay\", \"cedar\", undefined × 1, \"maple\"]`.\n",
    " - In the recent versions of Chrome you will see the word `empty` of `undefined x 1`.\n",
    " - When you run the same code in Firefox browser console then you will get `[\"redwood\", \"bay\", \"cedar\", undefined, \"maple\"]`\n",
    "  \n",
    "Clearly we can see that Chrome has its own way of displaying uninitialized index in arrays. However when you check `trees[3] === undefined` in any browser you will get similar output as `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Please remember that you need not check for the uninitialized index of the array in  `trees[3] === 'undefined × 1'` it will give an error because `'undefined × 1'` this is just way of displaying an uninitialized index of an array in chrome.\n",

    "```\n",
    "<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n",
    "The code above will output `5` as output. When we used `delete` operator for deleting an array element then, the array length is not affected by this. This holds even if you deleted all elements of an array using `delete` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when delete operator removes an array element that deleted element is no longer present in the array. In place of value at deleted index `undefined x 1` in **chrome** and `undefined` is placed at the index. If you do `console.log(trees)` output `[\"xyz\", \"xxxx\", \"test\", undefined × 1, \"apple\"]` in Chrome and in Firefox `[\"xyz\", \"xxxx\", \"test\", undefined, \"apple\"]`.\n",

    "The code above will print string `\"undefined\"` as output. According to associativity rule operator with the same precedence are processed based on their associativity property of operator. Here associativity of the assignment operator is `Right to Left` so first `typeof y` will evaluate first which is string `\"undefined\"` and assigned to `z` and then `y` would be assigned the value of z.

    "All modern browsers (including IE9+) support the [`getOwnPropertyNames`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyNames) method, so we can calculate the length using the following code: \n",

    "Notice how `helloWorld` refer to `this` properties of obj. Here it's clear or you might have already understood that `this` gets bound to `obj`. But the interesting point that we can copy a reference to the same function `helloWorld` in another object and get a difference answer. Let see:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var obj2 = {\n",

    "\n",
    "The third use of functions is as constructors. Like function and method, `constructors` are defined with function.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike function calls and method calls, a constructor call `new Employee('John Doe', 28)` creates a brand new object and passes it as the value of `this`, and implicitly returns the new object as its result.\n",

    "In JS, that difference is quite subtle. A function is a piece of code that is called by name and function itself not associated with any object and not defined inside any object. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. parameter) and can optionally return data (the return value).\n",

    "A method is a piece of code that is called by its name and that is associated with the object. Methods are functions.

    "## Question 26. What is IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) and how it can be useful?\n",
    "<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "IIFE a function that runs as soon as it's defined. Usually it's anonymous (doesn't have a function name), but it also can be named. Here's an example of IIFE:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "(function() {\n",
    "  console.log(\"Hi, I'm IIFE!\");\n",
    "})();\n",
    "// outputs \"Hi, I'm IIFE!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here's how it works. Remember the difference between function statements (`function a () {}`) and function expressions (`var a = function() {}`)? So, IIFE is a function expression. To make it an expression we surround our function declaration into the parens. We do it to explicitly tell the parser that it's an expression, not a statement (JS doesn't allow statements in parens).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the function you can see the two `()` braces, this is how we run the function we just declared. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's it. The rest is details.  \n",
    "- The function inside IIFE doesn't have to be anonymous. This one will work perfectly fine and will help to detect your function in a stacktrace during debugging: \n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  (function myIIFEFunc() {\n",
    "    console.log(\"Hi, I'm IIFE!\");\n",
    "  })();\n",
    "  // outputs \"Hi, I'm IIFE!\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- It can take some parameters:\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  (function myIIFEFunc(param1) {\n",
    "    console.log(\"Hi, I'm IIFE, \" + param1);\n",
    "  })(\"Yuri\");\n",
    "  // outputs \"Hi, I'm IIFE, Yuri!\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Here there value `\"Yuri\"` is passed to the `param1` of the function.\n",
    "- It can return a value: \n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  var result = (function myIIFEFunc(param1) {\n",
    "    console.log(\"Hi, I'm IIFE, \" + param1);\n",
    "    return 1;\n",
    "  })(\"Yuri\");\n",
    "  // outputs \"Hi, I'm IIFE, Yuri!\"\n",
    "  // result variable will contain 1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- You don't have to surround the function declaration into parens, although it's the most common way to define IIFE. Instead you can use any of the following forms: \n",
    "  - `~function(){console.log(\"hi I'm IIFE\")}()`\n",
    "  - `!function(){console.log(\"hi I'm IIFE\")}()`\n",
    "  - `+function(){console.log(\"hi I'm IIFE\")}()`\n",
    "  - `-function(){console.log(\"hi I'm IIFE\")}()`\n",

    "<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "The singleton pattern is an often used JavaScript design pattern. It provides a way to wrap the code into a logical unit that can be accessed through a single variable. The Singleton design pattern is used when only one instance of an object is needed throughout the lifetime of an application. In JavaScript, Singleton pattern have many uses, they can be used for NameSpacing, which reduce the number of global variables in your page (prevent from polluting global space), organizing the code in a consistent manner, which increase the readability and maintainability of your pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important points in the traditional definition of Singleton pattern:\n",
    "- There should be only one instance allowed for a class and\n",
    "- We should allow global point of access to that single instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me define singleton pattern in JavaScript context:\n",
    "\n",
    "> It is an object that is used to create namespace and group together a related set of methods and attributes (encapsulation) and if we allow to initiate then it can be initiated only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, we can create singleton though object literal. However, there is some another way but that I will cover in next post.\n",
    "\n",
    "A singleton object consists of two parts: The object itself, containing the members (Both methods and attributes) within it, and global variable used to access it. The variable is global so that object can be accessed anywhere in the page, this is a key feature of the singleton pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JavaScript: A Singleton as a Namespace**\n",
    "\n",
    "As I have already stated above that singleton can be used to declare Namespace in JavaScript. NameSpacing is a large part of responsible programming in JavaScript. Because everything can be overwritten, and it is very easy to wipe out variable by mistake or a function, or even a class without even knowing it.

They are especially useful when we need to do an async operation and THEN do another async operation based on the results of the first one. For example, if you want to request the list of all flights and then for each flight you want to request some details about it. The promise represents the future value. It has an internal state (`pending`, `fulfilled` and `rejected`) and works like a state machine.\n",

    "\n",
    "<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "The ECMAScript 5 **Object.create()** method is the easiest way for one object to inherit from another, without invoking a constructor function. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For instance:** \n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var employee = {\n",
    "  name: 'Nishant',\n",
    "  displayName: function () {\n",
    "    console.log(this.name);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "var emp1 = Object.create(employee);\n",
    "console.log(emp1.displayName());  // output \"Nishant\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we create a new object `emp1` that inherits from `employee`. In other words `emp1`'s prototype is set to `employee`. After this emp1 is able to access the same properties and method on employee until new properties or method with the same name are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For instance:** Defining `displayName()` method on `emp1` will not automatically override the employee `displayName`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "emp1.displayName = function() {\n",
    "\tconsole.log('xyz-Anonymous');\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "employee.displayName(); //Nishant\n",
    "emp1.displayName();//xyz-Anonymous\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this **`Object.create(`)** method also allows to specify a second argument which is an object containing additional properties and methods to add to the new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var emp1 = Object.create(employee, {\n",
    "\tname: {\n",
    "\t\tvalue: \"John\"\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "emp1.displayName(); // \"John\"\n",
    "employee.displayName(); // \"Nishant\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the example above, `emp1` is created with it's own value for name, so calling **displayName()** method will display `\"John\"` instead of `\"Nishant\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object created in this manner give you full control over newly created object. You are free to add, remove any properties and method you want.\n",

    "```\n",
    "**2: Seal :**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is same as prevent extension, in addition to this also prevent existing properties and methods from being deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To seal an object, we use **Object.seal()** method. you can check whether an object is sealed or not using **Object.isSealed();**\n",

    "<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Object can have properties that don't show up when you iterate through object using for...in loop or using Object.keys() to get an array of property names. This properties is know as non-enumerable properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let say we have following object\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var person = {\n",
    "\tname: 'John'\n",
    "};\n",
    "person.salary = '10000$';\n",
    "person['country'] = 'USA';\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(Object.keys(person)); // ['name', 'salary', 'country']\n",
    "```\n",
    "As we know that person object properties `name`, `salary` ,`country` are enumerable hence it's shown up when we called Object.keys(person).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a non-enumerable property we have to use **Object.defineProperty()**. This is a special method for creating non-enumerable property in JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var person = {\n",
    "\tname: 'John'\n",
    "};\n",

    "\n",
    "Object.keys(person); // ['name', 'salary', 'country']\n",

    "**Object.defineProperty()** also lets you create read-only properties as we saw above, we are not able to modify phoneNo value of a person object. This is because descriptor has **writable** property, which is `false` by default. Changing non-writable property value will return error in strict mode. In non-strict mode it won't through any error but it won't change the value of phoneNo.\n",

    "\n",
    "<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    " Function binding falls in advance JavaScript category and this is very popular technique to use in conjunction with event handler and callback function to preserve code execution context while passing function as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var clickHandler = {\n",

    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "var btn = document.getElementById('myBtn');\n",
    "// Add click event to btn\n",
    "btn.addEventListener('click', clickHandler.handleClick);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here in this example clickHandler object is created which contain message properties and handleClick method.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have assigned handleClick method to a DOM button, which will be executed in response of click. When the button is clicked, then handleClick method is being called and console message. Here console.log should log the `click event handler` message but it actually log `undefined`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of displaying `undefined` is because of the execution context of clickHandler.handleClick method is not being saved hence `this` pointing to button `btn` object. We can fix this issue using bind method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var clickHandler = {\n",
    "\tmessage: 'click event handler',\n",
    "\thandleClick: function(event) {\n",
    "\t\tconsole.log(this.message);\n",
